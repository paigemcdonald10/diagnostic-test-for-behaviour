# diagnostic-test-for-behaviour

This project uses ROC curve analysis to develop a diagnostic test to detect changes in animal behaviour identified automatically by an electronic system. 

The interval between events at the electronic system is used to detect when replacements occur, which is when 1 animal aggressively takes the position of another animal at the electronic system.
